  - There is a huge spike in the number of Death cases in Italy.
  - For china, we can see that the graph didnt rise up alot due to the Early Lockdown that was imposed in the country
  - The number of Deaths in India has been very minimal compared to others.

 - We see that the Recovery cases has been highest by China due the Lockdown imposed.
 - The Recovery for Italy has been very less, which shows that the rules were not followed properly by the public and proper steps were not taken by the Government to put a hold at the pandemic
